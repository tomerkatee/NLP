covering a total area of ', ' New Zealand is about  east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and  south of the islands of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga', \" The country's varied topography and sharp mountain peaks, including the Southern Alps, owe much to tectonic uplift and volcanic eruptions\", \" New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, and its most populous city is Auckland\", '\\n\\nOwing to their remoteness, the islands of New Zealand were the last large habitable landmass to be settled by humans', ' Between about 1280 and 1350, Polynesians began to settle in the islands and then developed a distinctive Māori culture', ' In 1642, the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight and record New Zealand', ' In 1840, representatives of the United Kingdom and Māori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi, which declared British sovereignty over the islands', ' In 1841, New Zealand became a colony within the British Empire, and in 1907 it became a dominion; it gained full statutory independence in 1947, and the British monarch remained the head of state', \" Today, the majority of New Zealand's population of 5 million is of European descent; the indigenous Māori are the largest minority, followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders\", \" Reflecting this, New Zealand's culture is mainly derived from Māori and early British settlers, with recent broadening of culture arising from increased immigration\", ' The official languages are English, Māori, and New Zealand Sign Language, with the local dialect of English being dominant', '\\n\\nA developed country, New Zealand ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance, such as quality of life, education, protection of civil liberties, government transparency, and economic freedom', ' New Zealand underwent major economic changes during the 1980s, which transformed it from a protectionist to a liberalised free-trade economy', ' The service sector dominates the national economy, followed by the industrial sector, and agriculture', ' International tourism is also a significant source of revenue', ' Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, unicameral Parliament, while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet, led by the prime minister, currently Jacinda Ardern', \" Queen Elizabeth II is the country's monarch and is represented by the governor-general\", ' In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes', \" The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing states in free association with New Zealand); and the Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica\", '\\n\\nNew Zealand is a member of the United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, OECD, ASEAN Plus Six, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Pacific Community and the Pacific Islands Forum', '\\n\\nEtymology\\n\\nThe first European visitor to New Zealand, Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, named the islands Staten Land, believing they were part of the  that Jacob Le Maire had sighted off the southern end of South America', \" Hendrik Brouwer proved that the South American land was a small island in 1643, and Dutch cartographers subsequently renamed Tasman's discovery  from Latin, after the Dutch province of Zeeland\", ' This name was later anglicised to New Zealand', '\\n\\nThis was written as Nu Tireni in the Māori language', ' In 1834 a document written in Māori and entitled \"\" was translated into English and became the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand', ' It was prepared by , the United Tribes of New Zealand, and a copy was sent to King William IV who had already acknowledged the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand, and who recognised the declaration in a letter from Lord Glenelg', \"\\n\\n (pronounced  in Māori and  in English; often translated as 'land of the long white cloud') is the current Māori name for New Zealand\", ' It is unknown whether Māori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of Europeans;  originally referred to just the North Island', \" Māori had several traditional names for the two main islands, including  ('the fish of ') for the North Island and  ('the waters of greenstone') or  ('the canoe of ') for the South Island\", ' Early European maps labelled the islands North (North Island), Middle (South Island) and South (Stewart Island / )', ' In 1830, mapmakers began to use \"North\" and \"South\" on their maps to distinguish the two largest islands, and by 1907 this was the accepted norm', ' The New Zealand Geographic Board discovered in 2009 that the names of the North Island and South Island had never been formalised, and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013', ' This set the names as North Island or , and South Island or ', ' For each island, either its English or Māori name can be used, or both can be used together', ' Similarly the Māori and English names for the whole country are sometimes used together (Aotearoa New Zealand); however, this has no official recognition', '\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nNew Zealand is one of the last major landmasses settled by humans', ' Radiocarbon dating, evidence of deforestation and mitochondrial DNA variability within Māori populations suggest that Eastern Polynesians first settled the New Zealand archipelago between 1250 and 1300, although newer archaeological and genetic research points to a date no earlier than about 1280, with at least the main settlement period between about 1320 and 1350, consistent with evidence based on genealogical traditions', ' This represented a culmination in a long series of voyages through the Pacific islands', ' Over the centuries that followed, the Polynesian settlers developed a distinct culture now known as Māori', ' The population formed different  (tribes) and  (subtribes) which would sometimes cooperate, sometimes compete and sometimes fight against each other', ' At some point, a group of Māori migrated to , now known as the Chatham Islands, where they developed their distinct Moriori culture', ' The Moriori population was all but wiped out between 1835 and 1862 in the Moriori genocide, largely because of Taranaki Māori invasion and enslavement in the 1830s, although European diseases also contributed', ' In 1862, only 101 survived, and the last known full-blooded Moriori died in 1933', \"\\n\\nIn a hostile 1642 encounter between Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri and Dutch explorer Abel Tasman's crew, four of Tasman's crew members were killed, and at least one Māori was hit by canister shot\", ' Europeans did not revisit New Zealand until 1769, when British explorer James Cook mapped almost the entire coastline', ' Following Cook, New Zealand was visited by numerous European and North American whaling, sealing, and trading ships', ' They traded European food, metal tools, weapons, and other goods for timber, Māori food, artefacts, and water', ' The introduction of the potato and the musket transformed Māori agriculture and warfare', ' Potatoes provided a reliable food surplus, which enabled longer and more sustained military campaigns', ' The resulting intertribal Musket Wars encompassed over 600 battles between 1801 and 1840, killing 30,000–40,000 Māori', ' From the early 19th century, Christian missionaries began to settle New Zealand, eventually converting most of the Māori population', ' The Māori population declined to around 40% of its pre-contact level during the 19th century; introduced diseases were the major factor', '\\n\\nThe British Government appointed James Busby as British Resident to New Zealand in 1832 following a petition from northern Māori', ' His duties were to protect British commerce, mediate between the unruly Pākehā (European) settlers and Māori, and to apprehend escaped convicts', ' In 1835, following an announcement of impending French settlement by Charles de Thierry, the nebulous United Tribes of New Zealand sent a Declaration of Independence to King William IV of the United Kingdom asking for protection', ' Ongoing unrest, the proposed settlement of New Zealand by the New Zealand Company (which had already sent its first ship of surveyors to buy land from Māori) and the dubious legal standing of the Declaration of Independence prompted the Colonial Office to send Captain William Hobson to claim sovereignty for the United Kingdom and negotiate a treaty with the Māori', ' The Treaty of Waitangi was first signed in the Bay of Islands on 6 February 1840', \" In response to the New Zealand Company's attempts to establish an independent settlement in Wellington and French settlers purchasing land in Akaroa, Hobson declared British sovereignty over all of New Zealand on 21 May 1840, even though copies of the treaty were still circulating throughout the country for Māori to sign\", ' With the signing of the treaty and declaration of sovereignty, the number of immigrants, particularly from the United Kingdom, began to increase', '\\n\\nNew Zealand was administered as part of the Colony of New South Wales until becoming a separate Crown colony, the Colony of New Zealand on 3 May 1841', ' Armed conflict began between the colonial government and Māori in 1843 with the Wairau Affray over land and disagreements over sovereignty', ' These conflicts, mainly in the North Island, saw thousands of imperial troops and the Royal Navy come to New Zealand and became known as the New Zealand Wars', ' Following these armed conflicts, large amounts of Māori land was confiscated by the government to meet settler demands', '\\n\\nThe colony gained a representative government in 1852, and the first Parliament met in 1854', ' In 1856 the colony effectively became self-governing, gaining responsibility over all domestic matters (except native policy, which was granted in the mid-1860s)', ' Following concerns that the South Island might form a separate colony, premier Alfred Domett moved a resolution to transfer the capital from Auckland to a locality near Cook Strait', ' Wellington was chosen for its central location, with Parliament officially sitting there for the first time in 1865', '\\n\\nIn 1891 the Liberal Party came to power as the first organised political party', ' The Liberal Government, led by Richard Seddon for most of its period in office, passed many important social and economic measures', ' In 1893 New Zealand was the first nation in the world to grant all women the right to vote and in 1894 pioneered the adoption of compulsory arbitration between employers and unions', '\\n\\nIn 1907, at the request of the New Zealand Parliament, King Edward VII proclaimed New Zealand a Dominion within the British Empire, reflecting its self-governing status', ' In 1947 the country adopted the Statute of Westminster, confirming that the British Parliament could no longer legislate for New Zealand without the consent of New Zealand', '\\n\\nEarly in the 20th century, New Zealand was involved in world affairs, fighting in the First and Second World Wars and suffering through the Great Depression', ' The depression led to the election of the first Labour Government and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state and a protectionist economy', ' New Zealand experienced increasing prosperity following the Second World War, and Māori began to leave their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of work', ' A Māori protest movement developed, which criticised Eurocentrism and worked for greater recognition of Māori culture and of the Treaty of Waitangi', ' In 1975, a Waitangi Tribunal was set up to investigate alleged breaches of the Treaty, and it was enabled to investigate historic grievances in 1985', ' The government has negotiated settlements of these grievances with many iwi, although Māori claims to the foreshore and seabed proved controversial in the 2000s', '\\n\\nGovernment and politics\\n\\nNew Zealand is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy, although its constitution is not codified', ' Elizabeth II is the queen of New Zealand and thus the head of state', ' The queen is represented by the governor-general, whom she appoints on the advice of the prime minister', \" The governor-general can exercise the Crown's prerogative powers, such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of ministers, ambassadors, and other key public officials, and in rare situations, the reserve powers (e\", 'g', ' the power to dissolve parliament or refuse the royal assent of a bill into law)', ' The powers of the monarch and the governor-general are limited by constitutional constraints, and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of ministers', '\\n\\nThe New Zealand Parliament holds legislative power and consists of the queen and the House of Representatives', ' It also included an upper house, the Legislative Council, until this was abolished in 1950', ' The supremacy of parliament over the Crown and other government institutions was established in England by the Bill of Rights 1689 and has been ratified as law in New Zealand', ' The House of Representatives is democratically elected, and a government is formed from the party or coalition with the majority of seats', ' If no majority is formed, a minority government can be formed if support from other parties during confidence and supply votes is assured', ' The governor-general appoints ministers under advice from the prime minister, who is by convention the parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition', ' Cabinet, formed by ministers and led by the prime minister, is the highest policy-making body in government and responsible for deciding significant government actions', ' Members of Cabinet make major decisions collectively and are therefore collectively responsible for the consequences of these decisions', '\\n\\nA parliamentary general election must be called no later than three years after the previous election', ' Almost all general elections between  and  were held under the first-past-the-post voting system', ' Since the , a form of proportional representation called mixed-member proportional (MMP) has been used', \" Under the MMP system, each person has two votes; one is for a candidate standing in the voter's electorate, and the other is for a party\", ' Based on the 2018 census data, there are 72 electorates (which include seven Māori electorates in which only Māori can optionally vote), and the remaining 48 of the 120 seats are assigned so that representation in parliament reflects the party vote, with the threshold that a party must win at least one electorate or 5% of the total party vote before it is eligible for a seat', '\\n\\nElections since the 1930s have been dominated by two political parties, National and Labour', ' Between March 2005 and August 2006, New Zealand became the first country in the world in which all the highest offices in the land\\xa0– head of state, governor-general, prime minister, speaker, and chief justice\\xa0– were occupied simultaneously by women', ' The current prime minister is Jacinda Ardern, who has been in office since 26 October 2017', \" She is the country's third female prime minister\", \"\\n\\nNew Zealand's judiciary, headed by the chief justice, includes the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, the High Court, and subordinate courts\", ' Judges and judicial officers are appointed non-politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain judicial independence', ' This theoretically allows the judiciary to interpret the law based solely on the legislation enacted by Parliament without other influences on their decisions', \"\\n\\nNew Zealand is identified as one of the world's most stable and well-governed states\", '  the country was ranked fourth in the strength of its democratic institutions, and first in government transparency and lack of corruption', ' A 2017 human rights report by the US Department of State noted that the New Zealand government generally respected the rights of individuals, but voiced concerns regarding the social status of the Māori population', ' New Zealand ranks highly for civic participation in the political process, with 80% voter turnout during recent elections, compared to an  average of 68%', '\\n\\nForeign relations and military\\n\\nEarly colonial New Zealand allowed the British Government to determine external trade and be responsible for foreign policy', ' The 1923 and 1926 Imperial Conferences decided that New Zealand should be allowed to negotiate its own political treaties, and the first commercial treaty was ratified in 1928 with Japan', ' On 3 September 1939, New Zealand allied itself with Britain and declared war on Germany with Prime Minister Michael Joseph Savage proclaiming, \"Where she goes, we go; where she stands, we stand', '\"\\n\\nIn 1951 the United Kingdom became increasingly focused on its European interests, while New Zealand joined Australia and the United States in the ANZUS security treaty', \" The influence of the United States on New Zealand weakened following protests over the Vietnam War, the refusal of the United States to admonish France after the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior, disagreements over environmental and agricultural trade issues, and New Zealand's nuclear-free policy\", \" Despite the United States's suspension of ANZUS obligations, the treaty remained in effect between New Zealand and Australia, whose foreign policy has followed a similar historical trend\", ' Close political contact is maintained between the two countries, with free trade agreements and travel arrangements that allow citizens to visit, live and work in both countries without restrictions', '  there were about 650,000 New Zealand citizens living in Australia, which is equivalent to 15% of the population of New Zealand', '\\n\\nNew Zealand has a strong presence among the Pacific Island countries', \" A large proportion of New Zealand's aid goes to these countries, and many Pacific people migrate to New Zealand for employment\", ' Permanent migration is regulated under the 1970 Samoan Quota Scheme and the 2002 Pacific Access Category, which allow up to 1,100 Samoan nationals and up to 750 other Pacific Islanders respectively to become permanent New Zealand residents each year', ' A seasonal workers scheme for temporary migration was introduced in 2007, and in 2009 about 8,000 Pacific Islanders were employed under it', ' New Zealand is involved in the Pacific Islands Forum, the Pacific Community, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum (including the East Asia Summit)', ' New Zealand has been described as an emerging power', ' The country is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and participates in the Five Power Defence Arrangements', \"\\n\\nNew Zealand's military services—the Defence Force—comprise the New Zealand Army, the Royal New Zealand Air Force, and the Royal New Zealand Navy\", \" New Zealand's national defence needs are modest since a direct attack is unlikely\", ' However, its military has had a global presence', ' The country fought in both world wars, with notable campaigns in Gallipoli, Crete, El Alamein, and Cassino', \" The Gallipoli campaign played an important part in fostering New Zealand's national identity and strengthened the ANZAC tradition it shares with Australia\", '\\n\\nIn addition to Vietnam and the two world wars, New Zealand fought in the Second Boer War, the Korean War, the Malayan Emergency, the Gulf War, and the Afghanistan War', ' It has contributed forces to several regional and global peacekeeping missions, such as those in Cyprus, Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Sinai, Angola, Cambodia, the Iran–Iraq border, Bougainville, East Timor, and the Solomon Islands', '\\n\\nLocal government and external territories\\n\\nThe early European settlers divided New Zealand into provinces, which had a degree of autonomy', ' Because of financial pressures and the desire to consolidate railways, education, land sales, and other policies, government was centralised and the provinces were abolished in 1876', ' The provinces are remembered in regional public holidays and sporting rivalries', '\\n\\nSince 1876, various councils have administered local areas under legislation determined by the central government', ' In 1989, the government reorganised local government into the current two-tier structure of regional councils and territorial authorities', ' The 249 municipalities that existed in 1975 have now been consolidated into 67 territorial authorities and 11 regional councils', ' The regional councils\\' role is to regulate \"the natural environment with particular emphasis on resource management\", while territorial authorities are responsible for sewage, water, local roads, building consents, and other local matters', ' Five of the territorial councils are unitary authorities and also act as regional councils', ' The territorial authorities consist of 13 city councils, 53 district councils, and the Chatham Islands Council', ' While officially the Chatham Islands Council is not a unitary authority, it undertakes many functions of a regional council', '\\n\\nThe Realm of New Zealand, one of 15 Commonwealth realms, is the entire area over which the queen of New Zealand is sovereign and comprises New Zealand, Tokelau, the Ross Dependency, the Cook Islands, and Niue', ' The Cook Islands and Niue are self-governing states in free association with New Zealand', ' The New Zealand Parliament cannot pass legislation for these countries, but with their consent can act on behalf of them in foreign affairs and defence', ' Tokelau is classified as a non-self-governing territory, but is administered by a council of three elders (one from each Tokelauan atoll)', \" The Ross Dependency is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica, where it operates the Scott Base research facility\", ' New Zealand nationality law treats all parts of the realm equally, so most people born in New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau, and the Ross Dependency are New Zealand citizens', '\\n\\nGeography and environment\\n\\nNew Zealand is located near the centre of the water hemisphere and is made up of two main islands and more than 700 smaller islands', ' The two main islands (the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Māui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamu) are separated by Cook Strait,  wide at its narrowest point', \" Besides the North and South Islands, the five largest inhabited islands are Stewart Island (across the Foveaux Strait), Chatham Island, Great Barrier Island (in the Hauraki Gulf), D'Urville Island (in the Marlborough Sounds) and Waiheke Island (about  from central Auckland)\", '\\n\\nNew Zealand is long and narrow—over  along its north-north-east axis with a maximum width of —with about  of coastline and a total land area of ', ' Because of its far-flung outlying islands and long coastline, the country has extensive marine resources', ' Its exclusive economic zone is one of the largest in the world, covering more than 15 times its land area', '\\n\\nThe South Island is the largest landmass of New Zealand', ' It is divided along its length by the Southern Alps', ' There are 18 peaks over , the highest of which is  / Mount Cook at ', \" Fiordland's steep mountains and deep fiords record the extensive ice age glaciation of this southwestern corner of the South Island\", ' The North Island is less mountainous but is marked by volcanism', \" The highly active Taupō Volcanic Zone has formed a large volcanic plateau, punctuated by the North Island's highest mountain, Mount Ruapehu ()\", \" The plateau also hosts the country's largest lake, Lake Taupō, nestled in the caldera of one of the world's most active supervolcanoes\", '\\n\\nThe country owes its varied topography, and perhaps even its emergence above the waves, to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the Pacific and Indo-Australian Plates', ' New Zealand is part of Zealandia, a microcontinent nearly half the size of Australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the Gondwanan supercontinent', ' About 25 million years ago, a shift in plate tectonic movements began to contort and crumple the region', ' This is now most evident in the Southern Alps, formed by compression of the crust beside the Alpine Fault', ' Elsewhere, the plate boundary involves the subduction of one plate under the other, producing the Puysegur Trench to the south, the Hikurangi Trench east of the North Island, and the Kermadec and Tonga Trenches further north', '\\n\\nNew Zealand is part of a region known as Australasia, together with Australia', ' It also forms the southwestern extremity of the geographic and ethnographic region called Polynesia', ' The term Oceania is often used to denote the wider region encompassing the Australian continent, New Zealand and various islands in the Pacific Ocean that are not included in the seven-continent model', \"\\n\\nClimate\\n\\nNew Zealand's climate is predominantly temperate maritime (Köppen: Cfb), with mean annual temperatures ranging from  in the south to  in the north\", ' Historical maxima and minima are  in Rangiora, Canterbury and  in Ranfurly, Otago', ' Conditions vary sharply across regions from extremely wet on the West Coast of the South Island to semi-arid in Central Otago and the Mackenzie Basin of inland Canterbury, and subtropical in Northland', ' Of the seven largest cities, Christchurch is the driest, receiving on average only  of rain per year and Wellington the wettest, receiving almost twice that amount', ' Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch all receive a yearly average of more than 2,000 hours of sunshine', ' The southern and southwestern parts of the South Island have a cooler and cloudier climate, with around 1,400–1,600 hours; the northern and northeastern parts of the South Island are the sunniest areas of the country and receive about 2,400–2,500 hours', ' The general snow season is early June until early October, though cold snaps can occur outside this season', ' Snowfall is common in the eastern and southern parts of the South Island and mountain areas across the country', \"\\n\\nThe table below lists climate normals for the warmest and coldest months in New Zealand's six largest cities\", ' North Island cities are generally warmest in February', ' South Island cities are warmest in January', \"\\n\\nBiodiversity\\n\\nNew Zealand's geographic isolation for 80 million years and island biogeography has influenced evolution of the country's species of animals, fungi and plants\", ' Physical isolation has caused biological isolation, resulting in a dynamic evolutionary ecology with examples of distinctive plants and animals as well as populations of widespread species', \" The flora and fauna of New Zealand were originally thought to have originated from New Zealand's fragmentation off from Gondwana, however more recent evidence postulates species resulted from dispersal\", \" About 82% of New Zealand's indigenous vascular plants are endemic, covering 1,944 species across 65 genera\", ' The number of fungi recorded from New Zealand, including lichen-forming species, is not known, nor is the

occurred after humans arrived, with around half the forest cover lost to fire after Polynesian settlement', ' Much of the remaining forest fell after European settlement, being logged or cleared to make room for pastoral farming, leaving forest occupying only 23% of the land', '\\n\\nThe forests were dominated by birds, and the lack of mammalian predators led to some like the kiwi, kākāpō, weka and takahē evolving flightlessness', \" The arrival of humans, associated changes to habitat, and the introduction of rats, ferrets and other mammals led to the extinction of many bird species, including large birds like the moa and Haast's eagle\", '\\n\\nOther indigenous animals are represented by reptiles (tuatara, skinks and geckos), frogs, spiders, insects (), and snails', ' Some, such as the tuatara, are so unique that they have been called living fossils', ' Three species of bats (one since extinct) were the only sign of native land mammals in New Zealand until the 2006 discovery

basis for strong economic growth in New Zealand', ' High demand for agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both Australia and Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s', \" In 1973, New Zealand's export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the European Economic Community and other compounding factors,
